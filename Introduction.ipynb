    "## What is statistics, Descriptive and Inferential statistics, Probability\n",
    "* **Statistics** deals with collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. \n",
    "* Organizing and summarizing a data is called **Descriptive statistics**. We can summarize the data by graph and by using numbers.\n",
    "* **Inferential statistics**: Drawing conclusion from good data. It uses probability to determine how confident we are that our conclusions are correct.\n",
    "* Probability is used to study randomness. Deals with the chance of an event occurring.\n",
    "* Summary statistics is the single number summarizing a large amount of data.\n",
    "* Statistics can be viewed as,\n",
    "    - Art of summarizing data: Reduction and summarization of data so human observer can understand\n",
    "    - Science of uncertainty: Assess whether claims are meaningful and how far reported finding may fall from the truth (Margin of error)\n",
    "    - Science of decision: \n",
    "    - Science of variation:\n",
    "    - Science of forecasting:\n",
    "### Types of Data\n",
    "#### Organic/process data\n",
    "* Generated by computerized system or extracted from video or audio recordings. They are generated organically as result of some process and also generated over time. Ex. Financial, stock market exchanges, Netflix viewing history, point of sale transaction, web browser activity, weather sensors\n",
    "* Generate massive data (Big Data)\n",
    "#### Data collection\n",
    "* Designed to specifically address a stated research objective\n",
    "    - Individual sampled from population, interviewed about opinions on particular topic.\n",
    "    - Extract tweets based on subject and interest.\n",
    "* Main difference is this dataset are designed based on our need instead like organic dataset which grows very fast.\n",
    "* Smaller compared to organic\n",
    "* Data collected for specific reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure the data is i.id, independent and identical distribution. Independent means observation is completely unrelated with other observation. All observed values should arise from common statistical distribution.\n",
    "    * Ex. Final exam score from class is independent (Each student score is independent), all score follows normal distribution.\n",
    "* Data also can not be i.id."

    "## Population and Samples\n",
    "* During research always ask what is the population of interest and what is the sample,\n",
    "* Sampling means select portion of larger population and study that portion to gain info about the population. Data are the result of sampling from population.\n",
    "* Observing entire population is expensive, so sampling is needed.\n",
    "* From sample data we calculate statistics. Which is estimate of population parameter. A parameter is numerical characteristics of the whole population that can be estimated by statistics.\n",
    "* One main concern is how well statistics estimates parameter. Which is depends on how well the sample represents population. \n",
    "* Sample should have same characteristics as population it is representing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random sampling\n",
    "* Each member of population has equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "* True random sampling is done by replacement. Surveys are done without replacement. Because population is very large compared to sample, sampling without replacement or with replacement is almost same.\n",
    "#### Simple random sampling\n",
    "* Each case in population has equal chance of being selected. Ex. Drawing name from well mixed slips from bowl\n",
    "* Knowing that one case is included in the case does not provide useful information about what other case are included.\n",
    "![simple random sampling](images/simple_random_sampling.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stratified sampling\n",
    "* Population is divided into group called strata.Strata are chosen so similar case are grouped together. Simple random sampling is employed in each stratum. Ex. group the cricket team of all nations and draw 4 names from each group. Useful when we want same number of cases from individual groups.\n",
    "![stratified_sampling](images/stratified_sampling.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cluster sample\n",
    "* We break up population in many group called clusters. We sample fixed number of clusters and includes all the individuals from sampled clusters.\n",
    "* Useful when lots of case to case variability within the cluster but 2 clusters do not look different from one another.\n",
    "![cluster sampling](images/cluster_sampling.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multistage sample:\n",
    "* Rather than keeping all cases from clusters, we collect random sample within each selected clusters.\n",
    "![Multistage sampling](images/multistage_sampling.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Systematic sample\n",
    "* Randomly select starting point and take every nth data from listing of the population. Ex. Phone book has 20000 people listing. To choose 400 people from it, we can randomly choose 1 entry then choose every 15th name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-random sampling\n",
    "#### Convenience sampling\n",
    "* Involves result that are readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling bias\n",
    "* Sample which is not representative of sample is biased.\n",
    "* It occurs when some members is less likely to be chosen as others.\n",
    "* When person is taking sample, it is possible that he chooses case as per his interest. This will create bias.\n",
    "* Convenience sampling: Individual who are accessible are more likely to be chosen in sample.\n",
    "* Self selected/ voluntary response samples:  Responses by the people who are willing to response, call in survey.\n",
    "* Collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences response.\n",
    "* Non response: People with strong positive or negative opinion answer the survey.\n",
    "* In non response bias there is a random sample which was survey, but some of them dont want to answer, in voluntary response bias there is no random sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation does not imply causation\n",
    "* Relationship between 2 variables does not mean one causes other to occur. They might be related because of their relationship with 3rd variable.\n",
    "* Also make sure for sampling and non sampling error. Smaller sample is part of sampling error. Larger the sample smaller the sampling error. Defective counting device is non sampling error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variation in data\n",
    "* Two sample of the same population may vary slightly. But if variation is very large, it is the problem or an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency and relative frequency\n",
    "* Frequency is number of times value occurs.\n",
    "* Relative frequency is ratio of number of times value occur and total number of outcomes.\n",
    "* Cumulative relative frequency is accumulation of previous relative frequency. Add all previous relative frequency to the relative frequency of current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anecdotal evidence\n",
    "* Evidence based on limited sample which is NOT representative of population. Ex. My uncle smokes 3 packs of ciggarate per day but he is fine so it does not cause cancer."

In randomized experience researcher controls explanatory variable and measure changes in response variable. Different value of explanatory variable is called treatment.\n",
    "* Variable which can affect study are called **Lurking(confounding) variable**. Extraneous variable that affect both the explanatory and response variable and make it seem like there is relationship between them. To prove that the explanatory variable causes the change in response variable we need to get reed of such lurking variable.\n",

    "### Observational\n",
    "* Collect the data in a way that does not directly interfere how the data arise.Ex. Collect info via survey, review medical or company record.\n",
    "* Researcher only observe the data which arise. Such study can provide naturally occurring association between variables, but can not show causal connection.\n",
    "* To make causal statement in observational study just get rid of all confounding variables, but it is not possible.\n",
    "* It can be prospective study: Data is collected during the study or retrospective study:using past information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental\n",
    "* Individual are assigned in treatment and control group. If individual are assigned randomly such experiment is called randomized experiment. Generally control group receives placebo (fake treatment). Treatment group receives actual treatment which needs to be evaluated.\n",
    "* Association does not imply causation, causation can only be inferred by randomized experiment.\n",
    "* Randomized experiment build on 4 principles\n",
    "1. Controlling: Researchers tries best to control differences between treatment and control groups. Ex. To control the water consumption effect every individual will take a pill with 12 oz of water.\n",
    "2. Randomization: Researcher randomize patients in groups for account for variables which can not be controlled. \n",
    "3. Replication: More case researcher observe, more sure we are for effect of explanatory variable on response variable. We can get larger sample and replicate same experiment or other scientist replicate same experiment on same sample.\n",
    "4. BLocking: Some variables can influence the response. First group individual based on this variables into blocks and then randomize cases within each block to different groups.Ex. Divide patient in low risk and high risk blocks. Randomly assign high patient from each group to control and treatment group. Which ensure both group has equal number of low and high risk patients.\n",
